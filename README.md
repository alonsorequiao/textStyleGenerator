# Simple Javascript project - Text Style Generator

This is a small application that I created to practice pure HTML, CSS and JS. It might help beginners know how to:

- Change and check element's appearance with JS
- Control arrays, objects and alerts
- Create a really simple and useful loading bar
- Check the size of a div element

## How to use

This is a text style generator application. First you have to type anything inside the text-field. Then you may change the text size and color on a random way. After choose a combination between text, text size and color you liked, you may save it.

How many styles may I save? The div that stocks these styles has 402px of height. You can save only a certain quantity of styles that fit inside this height (the quantity depends on the text size). Sometimes you might fill, e.g. 98% of the space, and can't reach 100% because there is no text size able to fits 2% of space.

## Help

I know how simple and "weird" this application looks to be. But it contains knowledge that can help others. So if you have ANY idea on how we can improve and add more feature in this. Feel free to contribute, okay?

## Thanks
That's it and have fun!
